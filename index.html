    <p>I decided to take the Mobile Friendly Website class a few weeks before my Websites For Beginners class ended. I enjoyed learning how to use html and css to create a website. I wasn't aces at it, but I understood it â€“ which really surprised and excited me. In college, I had to take a basic computer science class as a GE, and whenever we had to use coding principles, I got lost. I love working with computers and technology, but after taking that class, I was convinced that my brain couldn't grasp the concepts of coding and how computers run. And then a few years later, when I heard about the Bitwise classes, I decided to try one out. My teachers from Websites for Beginners encouraged our class to take the next course, Mobile Friendly Websites. Since I was having a good time and learning new things, I thought it would wise to at least take the next class and have more skills for my resume. I don't really know what I'm doing with my life (other then trying to get a job) and since I'm good with computers, I think that it can't hurt to get a little better. I'm really happy with my decision to take this class, and I can't wait to learn more about coding and challenging myself with my newfound knowledge and skills. </p>
